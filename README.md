# Scrtach-Falling-Stars

A simple beginner game built in Scratch where the player controls a character to catch falling stars and earn points. 

## Gameplay 
- Use arrow keys (right and left) to move the catcher
- catch as many stars as possible within 20 seconds
- Score increases with each star caught

My first game project while learning programming fundamentals through CS50!
